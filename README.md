Implementation and comparation of algorithms that simplify time series.

In this repository i've implemented 3 algorithms of time series simplification, they are: PIPs, ZIGZAG and VOLCA.
To test and compare those algorithms i've implented scripts that generate grafics and scripts that calculate the error within the 
simplifications.
There are still a lot to be done to improve the code because i've learned python working on this, and because of that the code 
isn't optimized yet.
